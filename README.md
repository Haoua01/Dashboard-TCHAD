# Financial Inclusion Mapping in CEMAC Region

## Overview

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree (M2) in a dual program between **Université Paris Dauphine** and **Télécom Paris**, where I am working towards both a Master's and an engineering diploma. As part of my studies, I am completing a work-study program at the **Institut Louis Bachelier**, focusing on **financial inclusion** in the **CEMAC region**.

## Project

My project has a dual purpose, involving:
- My work at the **Digital Finance Chair** within the institute.
- The **Master's thesis** I am required to complete to validate my Master's degree.

### Objectives

The core of my work is to create a **map of banking and non-banking infrastructure** across the CEMAC region. Specifically, I am analyzing the various actors providing financial services in Chad and the broader CEMAC zone. The goal is to model the relationship between access to these facilities and the **economic development** of the region.

## Call for Collaboration

I am reaching out to request **documentation and data** to support an econometric study on this topic. I fully understand potential confidentiality constraints and am open to formalizing this collaboration through **NDAs** (Non-Disclosure Agreements). This could serve as a potential **academic collaboration**, and we can discuss further details if interested.

## Contact

Feel free to contact me for further discussions and collaboration opportunities.
